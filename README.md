# NgFundamentals

This is an updated version of the project created during the Angular Fundamentals course by Joe Eames and Jim Cooper on Pluralsight using Angular version 11.1.1. 

Some significant updates include:
- Replacing the routes.ts file with a routing module
- Rewriting the custom location validator to use the ValidationError and ValidatorFn classes
- Adding a responsive navbar and improving the overall design on smaller screens
- Using fontawesome instead of glyphicon 
  - You may need to install fontawesome to work with the icons used in this project. This can be done using 
  `npm i --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons` and 
  `npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`

If for some reason you find yourself taking this course, feel free to use this project as a reference.
